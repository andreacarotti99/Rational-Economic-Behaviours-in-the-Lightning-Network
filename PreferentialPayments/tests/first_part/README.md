Reproduce the results:

- run the file run_simulation.py with the chosen value of alfa (e.g. alfa = 0.1) and with the chosen parameters.
- this will generate a file in the same directory [results...].csv
- Copy the absolute file path of this file in the script run_merge, this will be to integrate the results with the nodes that didn't earn anything from the simulation
- run the script run_merge.py
- this will generate a file final_data.csv
- put the absoulte path of this file in the script run_merge.csv this will allow to create the buckets of the nodes for ease of visualization
- run the script run_bucket.py
- Now it will be possible to read the results,
