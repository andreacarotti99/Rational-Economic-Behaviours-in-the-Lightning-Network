- closing channels randomly means we pick randomly the channels to close
- if the copied node has a channel that the copier node already have, this channel will be duplicated
  (so potentially the degree of the copier will decrease if this keep happening since we have double channels between nodes)
- duplicate_already_present_channel was not yet introduced in these simulations
